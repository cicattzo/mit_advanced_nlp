There are certain parts of the scaffolding marked with `# Your code here!` comments where you can fill in code to perform the specified tasks. After implementing the methods in this notebook, you will need to design and perform experiments to evaluate each method and respond to the questions in the Homework 1 handout (available on Canvas). You should be able to complete this assignment without changing any of the scaffolding code, just writing code to fill in the scaffolding and run experiments."
